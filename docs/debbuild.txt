DEBBUILD Documentation

This is inspired by the Arch Build System [0], but is adapted to deb packages.

A .DEBBUILD file MUST contain the following fields:

* pkgname: the name of the package
* pkgver: the version of the package as given by the packaged software, so gcc 4.5.1 should have pkgver=4.5.1.
* pkgrel: the version of the DEBBUILD relative to pkgver. Essentially, another level of the version number.
* pkgdesc: the text description for this package
* source: a list of md5sums and urls to fetch source tarballs

A .DEBBUILD file SHOULD contain the following fields:

* arch: usually i386
* url: corresponding homepage to the packaged software
* licence: something like GPL, BSD, etc.

A .DEBBUILD file CAN contain the following fields:

* depends: for package dependencies (libraries, data, etc)
* makedepends: dependencies for building the package (make, gcc, etc)
* conflicts: other packages, which conflict with this package

Finally, a .DEBBUILD file will probably declare a build() function,
which by default looks like this:

	build() {
		cd "$srcdir/$pkgname-$pkgver"
		./configure --prefix=/usr
		make
		make DESTDIR="${pkgdir}" install
	}

It assumes the source tarballs unpacked into $srcdir and installs the program to $pkgdir.
The DEBBUILD file is just a shell script.

The simpledeb wrapper will the package the contents of $pkgdir,
together with the meta data specified in the fields above,
into a deb package file.
